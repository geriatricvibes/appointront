When designing your front‑end dashboard—without duplicating Calendly’s native functionality—you can focus on providing a central hub that helps users set up, customize, and monitor the chatbot integration. Here are the main sections and features you might consider:

---

## **1. Integration Setup & Instructions**

- **Website Embed Instructions:**  
  - **What:** Provide clear, copy‑and‑paste code snippets (JavaScript/iframe) for users to embed the chatbot widget on their website.  
  - **Why:** This helps users quickly integrate the chatbot without additional setup.

- **Calendly Connection Status:**  
  - **What:** A section that shows whether the user’s Calendly account is connected.  
  - **Why:** Since you’re redirecting users to Calendly for advanced scheduling management, it’s important they know the integration status.  
  - **Extras:** Include a “Connect/Disconnect Calendly” button that initiates the OAuth flow or lets them re‑authenticate if needed.

- **Quick Start Guide / Setup Checklist:**  
  - **What:** A step‑by‑step guide (or checklist) summarizing what needs to be done (embed code, connect Calendly, configure notifications, etc.).  
  - **Why:** New users can quickly see what’s required for a successful integration.

## **2. Customization & Configuration**

- **Chatbot Appearance & Behavior Settings:**  
  - **What:** Options to change the widget’s color scheme, branding (logo, welcome message), and positioning on the site.  
  - **Why:** Letting users personalize the look and feel enhances consistency with their website’s design.

- **Notification Preferences:**  
  - **What:** Settings to configure notifications (email, SMS, in-app) for booking confirmations, cancellations, and reminders.  
  - **Why:** This allows users to tailor communication for a better customer experience.

- **General Chatbot Settings:**  
  - **What:** Options to adjust conversation flows or set default responses for common queries (if applicable).  
  - **Why:** Even if the appointment scheduling is offloaded to Calendly, managing the conversational part can improve user engagement.

## **3. Analytics & Reporting**

- **Engagement Metrics:**  
  - **What:** Overview of chatbot interactions, such as number of chats initiated, conversion rates (i.e., chats that lead to appointment bookings), and common queries.  
  - **Why:** Users can gauge the effectiveness of the chatbot in driving engagement and appointments.

- **Appointment Summary:**  
  - **What:** A summary view that might pull in key data from Calendly (like number of appointments booked, cancellations, or reschedules).  
  - **Why:** While you can’t replicate the full Calendly dashboard, a high‑level summary on your dashboard keeps users informed without leaving your platform.  
  - **Extras:** Include links or a button to “View Detailed Appointments” that redirects users to their Calendly dashboard if they need more in‑depth data.

- **Conversion Funnel Visualization:**  
  - **What:** A simple visualization showing how many visitors to the chatbot ultimately book an appointment.  
  - **Why:** This provides insight into potential areas of improvement in the chatbot’s flow.

## **4. Account Management & Support**

- **User Account Settings:**  
  - **What:** Basic settings where users can update their profile, change passwords, or manage billing information (if applicable).  
  - **Why:** Standard for any dashboard, this ensures users feel secure and in control.

- **Help & Documentation:**  
  - **What:** Links to detailed documentation, FAQs, video tutorials, and support contact options.  
  - **Why:** This minimizes friction for users who might need assistance during setup or when troubleshooting.

- **Feedback & Feature Requests:**  
  - **What:** A channel for users to provide feedback or request additional features.  
  - **Why:** Gathering this input can help prioritize future enhancements and ensure the platform evolves with user needs.

## **5. Optional Advanced Features**

- **Webhook/Event Log:**  
  - **What:** If your system supports webhooks (for example, notifications when an appointment is booked or canceled), provide a log or status view for recent events.  
  - **Why:** This helps power users and administrators monitor real-time activity and troubleshoot integration issues.

- **Integration with Other Tools:**  
  - **What:** If you plan on adding additional integrations (e.g., CRM systems, email marketing platforms), include a section that outlines available integrations and setup instructions.  
  - **Why:** Expanding functionality without duplicating Calendly ensures your dashboard remains a central hub for all scheduling and engagement activities.

## **Conclusion**


By focusing on these key areas, your dashboard becomes a one‑stop control panel where users can:
- Get clear setup instructions (embed code, Calendly connection).
- Customize the chatbot’s look and behavior.
- Monitor engagement and get a snapshot of appointment activity.
- Manage their account and access support resources.

This approach provides added value without duplicating Calendly’s native scheduling functionalities, while still giving users the tools they need to effectively integrate and manage the chatbot experience on their website.
